  summary: `<strong>Overview</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Mobile app for parents to track child location, school schedule, and events.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Problem</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Parents used multiple disconnected tools and still missed things.</li>
  <li>The issue was not missing tools. It was that none of them talked to each other.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Research</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Interviewed 12 parents using a conversational, close-circle approach.</li>
  <li>Parents felt reactive, not informed. They found out about things too late.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Design Decisions</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Three principles: inform not alarm, glanceable by default, scales from one child to three.</li>
  <li>Onboarding and daily use mapped as two separate flows with different needs.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Testing and Iteration</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Card carousel broke the glanceability goal. Replaced with a static summary view.</li>
  <li>Large warning icon caused anxiety before users read the message. Replaced with information-first layout.</li>
  <li>Both fixes re-tested and confirmed by the original feedback givers.</li>

        "Safetrack is a mobile app I designed for parents who want to stay informed about their children's day without having to constantly call or text them. The app brings together real-time location tracking, school schedules, class routines, and event notifications in one place.\n\nI started this project because I noticed something that seemed small but was actually a real daily frustration for a lot of parents around me: they were managing their child's school life across multiple things at once. A printed school calendar on the fridge, a WhatsApp group for school updates, a separate app for location, and still somehow missing things. The problem was not that the tools did not exist. The problem was that none of them talked to each other, and none of them were designed with a parent's actual day in mind.\n\nThis case study walks through how I went from that observation to a tested, iterated mobile app design. I will be honest about what worked, what did not, and what I would do differently if I did this again.",

He would rather see everything at once even if it meant more content on screen.\n\nThis was direct feedback against my own wireframe decision, and he was right. A carousel on the home screen directly contradicted my \"glanceable by default\" principle. I had written the principle and then broken it in my own design. I appreciated that he caught it.\n\nAnother participant had a strong reaction to the panic page. My wireframe had a large warning icon centered on the screen above the alert information. He said the icon would make him panic before he had even read what the alert was about. He felt a large danger symbol on his screen would make him assume the worst before he knew the facts.\n\nAgain, this directly contradicted my \"inform, not alarm\" principle.

        "HRMS is a web-based HR management system I designed to help HR teams handle recruitment, employee management, and payroll in one place. The project came from a simple observation: HR work involves a lot of steps that depend on each other, and most of the tools available either do too little or do too much in a way that makes them hard to actually use.\n\nWhen I started researching this, I expected to find that people wanted more features. What I actually found was the opposite. HR teams were not struggling because their tools lacked functionality. They were struggling because the tools they had were slow, disconnected from each other, and required too much manual work to keep synchronized. A candidate's status would be updated in one place but not another. A role would go unfilled for weeks after an employee resigned because nothing flagged it as vacant. Payroll data would live in a spreadsheet that had to be manually updated every time something changed in the HR system.\n\nThe problem was not missing features. It was missing connection between the steps that HR teams were already doing every day.\n\nThis case study documents how I went from that understanding to a tested, high-fidelity design for a system that tries to connect those steps rather than add to the pile.",

        "Recruitment is the part of HR work that tends to be the most time-consuming and the most prone to error. Here is what the process typically looks like without a proper system:\n\nA role opens up. Someone in HR writes a job description and manually posts it to multiple job boards one by one. Applications come in through different channels and have to be collected and sorted manually. Resume screening is done by reading through each one individually. Interview scheduling happens over email, with multiple back-and-forth messages to find a time that works. Hiring decisions get discussed in meetings and noted in someone's personal files. Offer letters are sent manually. Onboarding is a separate process that HR has to initiate manually once the hire is confirmed.\n\nAt every single step, information has to be moved from one place to another by hand. And at every step, there is a chance for something to be missed, delayed, or lost.\n\nBeyond recruitment, there is a specific problem that I found particularly interesting: what happens when an employee resigns. In most systems, the resignation is recorded, the exit process is handled, and then nothing happens automatically. The role that person was filling just becomes vacant, and it is up to someone in HR to notice and act on it. In busy departments, this can mean a role goes unfilled for weeks longer than it needed to because no one flagged it in time.",

I went through their interfaces, read user reviews, and noted where people consistently praised them and where they consistently complained. I also talked informally with HR colleagues and people I knew who worked in HR departments. These conversations were less formal than structured interviews but gave me real, specific examples of what the daily frustration actually looked like in practice.",

The dashboard is for a quick overview, and detailed data belongs on its own page with its own controls.\n\nThe recruitment section was split into two views. A list view shows all open roles with their applicant counts and pipeline status. Drilling into a role opens a Kanban-style pipeline board where every candidate is a card and every column is a hiring stage, from initial interview through technical test to final interview and hired. An HR manager can see the full picture at a glance without navigating away.\n\nThe employee list, attendance, and tasks pages all follow the same pattern: summary cards at the top for quick totals, and a data table below with filters, search, and inline actions on each row so common tasks do not require a separate page.",

She suggested adding a simple chart that shows overall attendance at a glance, so a manager does not have to read through individual records just to get a general sense of the week.\n\nShe was right.
